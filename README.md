# ToDo
- Create Cheet Sheets:
    - Difference between default exports, and named ones => default keyword
    - example on how to create + add the first component + what files actually are just default placeholder => App.tsx
    - Number Cheat Sheets, in a logical way, like a learning road map, what is needed when
    - What libraries/stuff is included just in default react, and what not? e. g. multiple pages actually is not a default!
    - multiple pages => Routing stuff
    - Tailwind setup: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite
    - Tailwind cheat sheet :D
    - How to get user inputs (e. g. forms)
        - controlled vs uncontrolled inputs
    - common React input events
    - React States
    - How does local storage work? 
        => what is SessionStorage? what other storage types are there?
        => Iterate over Items, filter them
        => json for more complex data
    - Refs from react, similar to static function variables in c
    - Common React Libraries, that people use to expand the core functionality: (Redux, Zustand, or even React Context?)
    - Timer => setTimeout
    - useEffect => only on mount?
